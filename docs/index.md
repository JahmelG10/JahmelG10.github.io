## STEM Weather Station Project
**Team Number:** 303

**Team Members:** Jahmel Garduno, Cade Clonts, Daniel Resnick

**Preperation Date:** Febuary 23, 2025

**Semester and Year:** Spring 2025

**University:** Arizona State University 

**Professor:** K. Nichols 


### **Team Role**
My role in the team is to develop the human interface subsystem for displaying temperature and humidity data from the sensor. For this subsystem, I will be using the PIC18F27Q10-I/SO microcontroller along with the Songhe OLED Display provided in class. This display will present real-time temperature and humidity readings, allowing users to interact with the data. Additionally, I will implement button controls that enable users to navigate through different data points and select the specific information they want to view.

To ensure seamless integration with the overall system, I will utilize a UART connection to send and receive data between the human interface subsystem and other components, including the sensor, actuator, and communication subsystems. My focus will be on maintaining efficient and responsive data transmission, ensuring that users receive accurate and timely environmental readings while enabling smooth interaction within the system.
