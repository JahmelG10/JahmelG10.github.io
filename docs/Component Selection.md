###  Power Budget Reflection

To estimate my systemâs power needs, I created a power budget table listing all major components along with their absolute maximum current draw, operating voltage, and quantity used. This allowed me to calculate the total current demand on the +3.3V power rail under worst-case conditions.

The key steps included:

* Summing the individual current draws of the microcontroller, OLED display, 5 LEDs, and pull-up resistors.
* Applying a 25% safety margin to account for potential current spikes or expansion.
* Comparing the total estimated current with the maximum current output of the LM2575WU switching regulator.

###  Conclusions:

* My total current draw, including the safety margin, is **223.28 mA**, which is well within the **1A (1000 mA)** capability of the LM2575WU.
* The external **12V wall supply** provides more than enough input power, leaving over **5000 mA** of unused capacity.
* The design is robust, reliable, and has enough power headroom to support future components or design modifications.

This process ensured that the system is electrically stable and that the chosen regulator and power source are not operating near their limits, which helps improve reliability and thermal performance.
