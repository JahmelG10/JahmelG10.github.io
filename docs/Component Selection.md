### **Microcontroller**

| Solution | Pros | Cons |
|----------|----------|----------|
| pic cost | - Faster Processing for complex tasks<br>- Built in Wifi and Bluetooth 5 Connectivity<br>- Larger memory storage | - Higher Power Consumption<br>- Complex Peripheral Management<br>- Much more complex memory management |
| Pic cost | - Simple and easy architecture to program<br>- Multiple low power modes; overall low energy consumption<br>- More Reliable for wired standalone subsystems | - No built in wireless capabilities<br>- Fewer advanced I/O options<br>- Limited memory for advanced applications |
| Pic cost | - Faster Processing speed<br>- Adjustable GPIO pins<br>- 2 UART and 2 ICSP Pins | - Slower processing speeds<br>- No built in wifi or bluetooth modules<br>- Requires complex PCB design for high frequency operation |

**Choice:**  
**Rationale:**

### **Voltage Regulator**

| Solution | Pros | Cons |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Pic cost | - High Efficiency<br>- High heat protection<br>- Prior use in class with through hole version | - Switch frequency make noise<br>- Limited Stock |
| Pic cost | - High Efficiency<br>- High Temperature Range | - Switch frequency makes noise<br>- Low dropout Voltage<br>- 5.5 V Max Input |
| Pic cost | - High Efficiency<br>- Very Inexpensive | - Very Difficult Soldering<br>- Low max Temp<br>- 6.5 V Max Input |

**Choice:**  
**Rationale:**
