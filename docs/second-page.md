**The schematic below details the Human Machine Interface (HMI) subsystem, ensuring fast real-time data display on the OLED screen from the sensor. This design incorporates several key sections, each serving a critical role in facilitating seamless data retrieval, processing, and visualization for the user.**

To support debugging and monitoring, the schematic includes a single debugging LED, providing a visual indicator for data transmission and system status. A reset button is integrated to facilitate system resets as needed. Additionally, dedicated headers are included to allow seamless connection with the Snap Debug Programmer, enabling efficient debugging and firmware updates.

A 3.3V voltage regulator is incorporated to ensure a stable power supply for the HMI subsystem. This schematic is designed to meet user needs and project requirements by enabling real-time data display, supporting UART communication, and facilitating efficient system debugging through dedicated interfaces.
